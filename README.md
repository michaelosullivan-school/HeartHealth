This is an app called 'HeartHealth', designed for being a little game that teaches about keeping your heart healthy.

The game is simple, use the buttons to move around and then press the 'start' button. A fireball will be launched at the heart and the user will have to use the movement buttons
in order to dodge the projectiles. If the heart is hit by the fireball, it will break and you will have to start over. Have fun!

Note: the white borders of the map will also cause the heart to be broken. While the game is still playable whilst the heart is broken, it is not intended and the user will
need to restart the app in order to play once again.
